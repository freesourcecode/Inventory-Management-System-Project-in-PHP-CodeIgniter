# Inventory Management System Project in PHP CodeIgniter with Source Code
An **Inventory Management System Project in PHP CodeIgniter** (also called an "inventory system") is a way to keep track of your goods from the time you buy them to the time you sell them.

It helps you to manage an organization’s day-to-day inventory.

The system allows users to export data to CSV or xlsx (Excel) files, which may then be printed.

You can also dynamically set up role permissions for other members or system users, which means you can create various user roles and manage their access to the system’s pages and features.
